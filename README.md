#Palindromes

To run:

```ruby test.rb```
This will return "true" as it's testing the 'abba' exmaple.

To run the specs:

Ensure you have Rspec installed
```gem install rspec```

Then ```rspec spec/palindrome_calculator_spec.rb```

This is a pretty quick and dirty implementation and hasn't been benchmarked for
performance.
